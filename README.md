#Data-stringer

###Was ist das?
**Data stringer:** the exact equivalent of wire agencies' (AFP/AP/Reuters) local journalists who feed the organisation with news (called *wires*).
Except that here, that's a software living in a dataset, not in Iran, that's going to do the job.

#Install

Getting started with Datastringer is easy:

* `git clone` the repo
* Run `install.sh`
* Run `node config.js` and go through the wizard

*Voilà!* You just set up your first datastringers, and you will be notified when these example alerts are triggered.
[Here is what these examples do](https://github.com/basilesimon/datastringer/blob/master/what-we-want.md)

#Do more with Datastringer

Datastringer is built on Javascript and Node.js, making it super easy to configure, run, and customise.
[Refer to the documentation](https://github.com/basilesimon/datastringer/wiki) to understand the architecture, rummage the examples and... build your own stringer!
