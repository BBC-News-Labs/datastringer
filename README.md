#Data-stringer

###Was ist das?
**Data stringer:** the exact equivalent of wire agencies' (AFP/AP/Reuters) local journalists who feed the organisation with news (called *wires*).
Except that here, that's a software living in a dataset, not in Iran, that's going to do the job.

###First job: gathering data sources
We will select three different data sources. Ideally, they will return data in three different formats, and will ask for three different methods to harvest and exploit the data.

* Police.uk REST API: JSON - [link](https://github.com/basilesimon/datastringer/tree/master/police.uk)

* Gov.uk RSS feeds: Atom - [link](https://github.com/basilesimon/datastringer/tree/master/gov.uk)
