#Data-stringer

###Was ist das?
**Data stringer:** the exact equivalent of wire agencies' (AFP/AP/Reuters) local journalists who feed the organisation with news (called *wires*).
Except that here, that's a software living in a dataset, not in Iran, that's going to do the job.

#Install

Getting started with Datastringer is easy:

* `git clone` the repo
* Run `install.sh`
* Run `node config.js` and go through the wizard

*Voil√†!* You just set up your first datastringers, and you will be notified when these example alerts are triggered.
[Here is what these examples do](https://github.com/basilesimon/datastringer/blob/master/what-we-want.md)

#Do more with Datastringer

Datastringer is built on Javascript and Node.js, making it super easy to configure, run, and customise.
Refer to the documentation to understand the architecture, rummage the examples and... build your own stringer!
