          Now is time to get a new data source in. I propose we use Police.uk again, as it has a set of questions which guarantee us some good pegs for our stories.<br>
          You can ask the API to give you several informations about your local police force, ranging from its members to planned events, and set priorities for our bobbies.

        <h3>
          <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> "That's not even data, man!"
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yeah, so what? Datastringer is not only good at crunching numbers according to your criteria. Its first role is to query, read, check, and compare for you a big set of things you would access with your computer. And to do that transparently, without needing you. <strong>That's computer-assisted reporting.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, the job here is simpler than before. We just need to know which local force you're interested in following. Datastringer will then detect the changes and alert you when a new police officer joins the force, or when an event is planned (and you should attend, free muffins!), or when new priorities are set.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i> Seems easy, right?</h3>
        <p>
          We will just need a GPS location. As before, go to the next page to get that easily.
