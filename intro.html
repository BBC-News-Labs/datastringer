        <p>
          We are going to help you configure a data source, based on <a href="http://www.police.uk/">Police.uk</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Police.uk has an API, i.e. a computer we can send questions to, and get answers in
          return. One of the questions we can ask Police.uk is
          <blockquote>"How many crimes, and what crimes, were commited in this area, during this
            month?"
          </blockquote>
          That's a rather cool question, eh? You can get these stats super easily for any place
          in the UK. If you are a local journalist, you will probably want to write
          stories about crime in your area. Well, I'd like to.

        <h3>
          <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> However, the raw numbers in themselves
          don't quite tell a story yet.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Knowing that 62 bicycles were stolen last month in Leicester is rather useless without
          context:
          <blockquote>Is it more than before? Is this number on the rise?</blockquote>
          To add context to these numbers, I have added some tweaking under the hood for this
          example. Not only will it fetch this month crime, it will also have a look
          at several months before, to compare how this month's crime numbers compare
          to a x-months average.

          We will need a set of dates, and a GPS location. The next page will help you get
          hold of these.
